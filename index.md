title: Responsible AI for Disaster Risk Management
---

This resource is intended to help practitioners and project managers working in disaster risk ensure that the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) technologies in particular, is done in a manner that is both effective and responsible. The content was produced over a 6 month interdisciplinary collaboration between experts from intergovernmental organizations, non-profits, academia, and the private sector. We are releasing it here in draft form in order to generate further discussion and gain additional feedback from our intended audience. It is our hope that, as a product produced through intensive consultation with the community who it is written for, that this resource will inform and improve the important work carried about by data scientists, risk modelers, and other technical experts working in disaster risk management (DRM).

To develop this resource, researchers from the World Bank Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), Columbia University, and Deltares convened 7 online meetings between January and March of 2020, where machine learning experts and other researchers working in the area of disaster data discussed the opportunities offered by machine learning tools in disaster risk management, potential risks raised by these tools, and opportunities for mitigation. On average, 17 individuals participated in each 90-minute session. These interdisciplinary conversations were shaped by joint readings of relevant research and presentation of detailed case studies. In addition, the project team conducted 14 in-depth interviews with data scientists working on these topics for their views. 

We present the preliminary findings of this process here, for wider review by the community. We have organized the body of the work around 4 key sources of threat: bias, privacy and security risks, lack of transparency and explainability, and hype. For each, we have presented an overview of the topic, realistic threat models along with hypothetical examples, strategies for managing these risks, and suggested further reading. Wherever possible, we keep the text here short and provide plenty of footnotes and links to more information. Over the next 3 months, we will publicize and present this resource for further iteration and review. Through this process, we sought to produce these recommendations collectively as members of the community of expert researchers and practitioners working to create and use disaster data effectively and responsibly.
